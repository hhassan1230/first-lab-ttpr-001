1. Which step felt least clear?
- All the steps were pretty clear but the command for adding new files was a little confusing. like, do i use 'echo' or what's the difference between that and git add

2. Why do we fork instead of pushing directly to the instructorsâ€™ repo?
- we use fork so that we can basically edit the repo adding our own twist in it, but without messing with the original repo.
