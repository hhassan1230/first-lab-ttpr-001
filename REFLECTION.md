Hey Hess, 

I realizied I should have added the comments I made to this reflection file (sorry about that). The steps were pretty direct, yet I realized in this venture with programming, one must take his/her own time to understand why/what is happening instead of just following the instructions. I'm going to guess that we fork before pushing directly into the instructors repo so we can edit or potentially mess up our parrallel universe without effecting the instructors main timeline?
