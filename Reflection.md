1. Everything was relatively clear to me. I think I have the most questions about the commands themselves.
For example, the echo command that was used as a shortcut to create a text file. I will have to learn more
and become accustomed to using these commands.

2. We fork as we are changing the project (Adding a new feature, so to speak). This may not be a change
the original creator approves, so we fork to create our own sandbox project and open a pull request after
to merge when we are done. The original creator can now approve or deny our request. If we were to edit
the original repo in this case, the first person to complete the assignment would overwrite the
instructor's project and basically already have the assignment finished for everyone after.
